# Getting Started

## Installing

You can install OStatsLib via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/ostatslib/)

```bash
pip install ostatslib
```

## Training

Agent is trained by getting exposed to different datasets that are randomly generated by OStatsLib environment.

``` python
from ostatslib.agents import PPOAgent

agent = PPOAgent()
agent.train()
```

Agent settings and policy model be persisted by calling `save` method.

``` python
agent.save('file_name')
```

Trained agent may be loaded by pointing to a saved agent zip file when initialized.

``` python
agent = PPOAgent('file_name.zip')
```
